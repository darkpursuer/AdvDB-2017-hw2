// I tested all the following query on cims server.

// a. Find the weighted (by quantity) average price of each stock over the entire time series.
SELECT stocksymbol,(sum(quantity*trade.price)/sum(quantity)) as average_price
FROM trade
GROUP BY stocksymbol
// time taken 8s520ms

// b. Find the vector of 10 trade unweighted moving averages (i.e. moving average of price) per stock.
SELECT stocksymbol,avgs(10,price) as unweighted_moving_avg
FROM trade
ASSUMING ASC time
GROUP BY stocksymbol
// time taken 10s480ms

// c. Find the vector of 10 trade weighted moving averages per stock.
SELECT stocksymbol,avgs(10,price*quantity)/avgs(10,quantity) as weighted_moving_avg
FROM trade
ASSUMING ASC time
GROUP BY stocksymbol
// time taken 13s560ms

// d. Find the single best buy first/sell later trade you could have done on each stock (your
// query should work on our data as well as yours). That is, for each stock, find the
// maximum positive price difference between a later sell and an earlier buy.
SELECT stocksymbol,max(price-mins(price))
FROM trade
ASSUMING ASC time
GROUP BY stocksymbol
// time taken 9s600ms
